# Cyborg Headpiece (cs207-2017-project) [Version 1.0.3]
License:  [*Unlicense*](http://unlicense.org)

This is the repository for Richard Yeomans' CS 207 Project.

A cyborg headpiece, by my definition, will be a piece of wearable technology,
affixed to the head of the wearer, but made to look as though it is integrated into the flesh of the wearer.

As my skill level with Arduino and electronics in general is still quite limited, I anticipate that this project will evolve a great deal as our class progresses and I learn more.  As such, going into much more detail regarding what I will create may not be valuable at this time.  Therefore, expect that this README will change and evolve with this project.


## Manifest
This directory structure will be generated once files are placed into the appropriate locations:
- **/build** - compiled code files
- **/examples** - example code to test hardware
- **/hardware** - printed circuit board files and 3D models (.ftz, .stl)
- **/img** - image files
- **/lib** - supplementary libraries required for build
- **/src** - source code files (.ino)
- **/LICENSE** - Unlicense file
- **/README.md** - this file


## Requirements and Materials
At this time, as I have not even selected my microcontroller, this list is more just ideas of what might be used:
### Dependencies
- [Adafruit NeoPixel Library] (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel)

### Bill of Materials
- 1x [Adafruit GEMMA v2](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1222)
- 1x [Adafruit FLORA](https://www.adafruit.com/products/659)
- 1x [NeoPixel Ring - 12 x 5050 RGB LED](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1643)


## Build Instructions
My printed circuit board (PCB) drawings will be going here, as well as instructions on how to construct the headpiece.


## Firmware Installation
Instructions on how to install code onto microcontroller.


## Usage
This section will be pretty simple: wear the headpiece.

- Upload the code
- How to turn it on
- How to control displays


## Team
The project team consists of:
- [Richard Yeomans](mailto:yeomansr@uregina.ca)

It's a small team.
